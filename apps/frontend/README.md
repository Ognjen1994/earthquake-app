### Frontend

The frontend is built with:

- **Next.js** for client and server side rendering.
- **TypeScript** for static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Apollo Client** for querying data needed on frontend.

### Available Scripts

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server for the Next.js application.
- **`lint`**: Runs ESLint to lint the project for potential code issues.
- **`generate`**: Generates GraphQL types and hooks based on the project's schema using `graphql-codegen`.
